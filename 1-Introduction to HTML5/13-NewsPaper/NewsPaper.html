        <h2>Dill Pickle Ranch Pasta Salad, The Dish To Bring To Every Potluck</h2>
        <h3><i>This features a secret star ingredient you likely already have in your fridge.</i></h3>
        <p>By <strong>Kelly Page</strong></p>
        <p>Summer is here and that means it’s potluck season. Bring on the backyard barbecues, the rooftop soirees and the outdoor dinners. Whenever I’m invited to these events I always want to bring that one dish that wows the other guests. You want to hear people whispering, “What’s in this? Who made it? How do I get the recipe?” while they shove another forkful in their mouths.</p>
        <p>Pasta salad is always a good choice to bring to these types of parties: It can be made ahead of time and tastes better the longer it sits. But there’s one problem ― it can be boring and flavorless.</p>
        <p>But good news: Making a stellar pasta salad only takes one simple ingredient you probably already have in the back of your fridge … pickle juice!</p>
        <p>Using the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/leftover-pickle-brine_n_578592b9e4b0867123ded70d" target="_blank">leftover brine</a> from a jar of pickles isn’t a new phenomenon: It’s been used to marinate chicken, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/5-strange-hangover-cures_b_5516653" target="_blank">cure hangovers</a>, add a zing to bloody marys and even <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pickle-juice-for-cramps" target="_blank">relieve cramps</a> in athletes. The juice and spices at the bottom of the jar are a delicious combination of vinegar, garlic, dill, mustard seeds, peppercorns and coriander seeds. It adds a brightness to dishes with a pop of acidity, sourness and tang. Think of it as a one-stop shop for flavor.</p>
